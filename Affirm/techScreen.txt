// Part 1
// --------
// Design a card game
// there are two players
// they draw a random card from a deck of cards having values [1...52]
// Whoever gets the bigger card, gets 2 points
// If the score ties the player with card 52 wins
// run the game and show the winner

First I tried generating random values 

// Part 2
//--------
// Extend the above game to take in a array of N player names
// The deck of card can be [1...M] now instead of [1...52]
// The points for each round will N instead on 2
// The M may not be a fully divisble by N
// In case there are leftover cards they are distributed between players randomly

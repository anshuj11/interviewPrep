Q1.  https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/



 Q2. Find maximum path in a binary tree - A path where each child node's value is greater than the parent node
    --All the nodes are distinct values
   --the path need not include root and leaf nodes
I just got asked this question in a tech screen, and I am not sure if my solution was correct. 
If you have seen/solved this question please share the link or solution.

function findMaxPath(root, path = 0, maxPath= 0){
  if(!root)
     return path
  if(root.left && root.val < root.left.val){
     if(maxPath <= path){
        maxPath = path+1
     }
     path = path+1;
     return findMaxPath(root.left, path, maxPath)
   }
   if(root.right && root.val < root.right.val){
      if(maxPath <= path){
        maxPath = path+1
     }
     path = path+1;
     return findMaxPath(root.right, path, maxPath)
   }
     
}


Notes:  Interviewer had a strong accent and was difficult to understand. She also seemed disinterested(but not rude) but 
warmed up towards the very end when I asked her about her experience.

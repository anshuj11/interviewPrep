Round1 : coderpad
-------

Create a graph ( undirected/directed your choice)
dynamically add edges to the graph
find and return the path between two nodes 


Round2 : coderpad
--------

Create a timeSeries based data structure
do the following operations:
set(key, value, timestamp)
get(key, timestamp);
return the value whose timestamp is maximum less than or equal to timestamp in the get call.

kv = new TimeMap;
kv.set( 'foo', 'bar', 1);
kv.set('foo', 'bar2', 4);
kv.get('foo', 3) //returns 'bar'
